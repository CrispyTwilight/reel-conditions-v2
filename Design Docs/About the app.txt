The Fishing Guide App project aims to develop a personalized Windows Forms desktop application tailored for individual fishermen, enhancing their fishing experiences through data-driven decision-making. Unlike community-centric platforms such as Fishbrain, this app prioritizes personal data, offering features like interactive map search, geolocation-based weather and water temperature information, saved location bookmarks, marked boat ramps, and integration with external fishing report databases. The primary data sources include the USGS database for water data and DNR for fishing reports. The user interface adopts a dark sage and black color scheme, with plans for multiple preliminary name and logo designs for client selection. Local data management involves storing location notes, search history, and app settings without encryption or account protection. User input controls include search, saved locations, and settings buttons, along with various modals and popups. The project has a tight timeline and budget, aiming for a quick delivery of an executable file via email or flash drive, with feedback gathered through phone or email. Legal and compliance issues are not a concern, and the app won't be maintained post-launch, but code separation is emphasized for potential future UI migration.
