# Fishing Guide App Project Overview

### Purpose and Impact
Personal use Windows Forms desktop application to assist fishermen in planning fishing trips and catching more fish. It will enhance the client’s fishing experience by providing essential data for making informed decisions. Unlike community-oriented apps like Fishbrain, this app will focus on the user’s personal data.

### Key Features
- **Map Search:** Interactive topographical map that can be searched for bodies of water.
- **Geolocation-based Data:** Weather and water temperature for various bodies of water.
- **Saved Locations:** Ability to bookmark and revisit favorite fishing spots.
- **Marked Boat Ramps:** Boat ramps and launches should be labeled on the map.
- **Fishing Reports:** Integration with external databases for fishing reports.
- **Coverage:** Begin with Iowa and Minnesota regions with the ability to expand.

### Must-Have Data (in order of importance)
1. Water Temperature
2. Air Temperature
3. Wind Speed

### Potential Data Sources
- USGS database for water data.
- DNR for fishing reports.

### User Interface
- Color scheme: Dark sage and black.
- Create multiple preliminary name and logo designs for client selection.

### Local Data Management Needs
- Store location notes, search history, and app settings (e.g., metric/imperial).
- This data does not need to be encrypted or protected with an account.

### User Input Controls
- Search text box and button
- Saved locations button
- Settings button
- Location data presentation area with various labels
- Notes text box with save button
- Various modals and popups for settings, reports, etc.

### Timeline and Budget
- Deliver as soon as possible with a budget of a few hundred dollars.

### Feedback and Iterations
- Deliverable: Executable file by email or flash drive.
- Feedback method: Phone or email.

### Other notes
- There are no legal or compliance concerns.
- The app will not be maintained after launch.
- There are no scalability concerns since this is a local application.
- Code separation should be practiced so the app can migrate to a different UI in the future.
